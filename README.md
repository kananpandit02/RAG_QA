# Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Based Multi-Document Question Answering System

This project aims to develop a system that leverages semantic search to retrieve relevant documents from a large and diverse corpus. It then uses retrieval-augmented generation techniques to produce fluent, factually grounded, and explainable natural language responses.

## Objectives

1. Retrieve relevant documents from a large, diverse corpus using semantic search.
2. Generate fluent, factually accurate, and explainable natural language answers.
3. Minimize hallucinations by ensuring all generated claims are traceable to source documents.

## Current Status

Currently focusing on dataset exploration (CORD-19, HotpotQA, EU Legislation), retrieval system design using semantic search, and in-depth paper study to inform development.
